# Python Sales Data Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive data analysis of sales data using Python. It is designed to help users gain insights into sales performance, trends, and customer behavior through data cleaning, exploration, and visualization.

## Features

- Load and preprocess raw sales datasets (CSV, Excel, etc.)
- Data cleaning and transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualization of sales patterns and trends
- Calculation of key sales metrics (total sales, average order value, etc.)
- Insights into top products, customers, and time periods
- Customizable reports and charts

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- pandas (data manipulation)
- numpy (numerical operations)
- matplotlib & seaborn (data visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (for interactive analysis)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package manager)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Mr-mills1/Python-Sales-Analysis-.git
    cd Python-Sales-Analysis-
    ```

2. Install the required Python packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### Usage

1. Place your sales data files (CSV, Excel, etc.) in the `data/` directory.
2. Open and run the analysis scripts or Jupyter notebooks provided in the repository.
3. View the generated visualizations and reports in the `output/` folder.

#### Example (Jupyter Notebook):

```python
import pandas as pd

# Load your sales data
data = pd.read_csv('data/sales_data.csv')

# Perform your analysis (see example notebooks/scripts)
```
